# Scattering covariance 

#### REPOSITORY INTO CONSTRUCTION.

This repository contains the implementation of the *scattering covariance*, a representation of time-series introduced in [1]. \
It is a minimal, incomplete version of the code and will be updated. 


## Usage

File main.py computes this representation for some parametrized models of time-series.
